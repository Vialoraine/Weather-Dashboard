  ## Description
  Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

  The following link demonstrates the application functionality: [Weather Dashboard](https://vialoraine.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/)
